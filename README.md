# Portfolio

Oblig 1:
Working with Oblig 1 was fun because we made a remake of an existing website. It was interesting to see if we were able to do it, and with the design system, it was a little easier. I liked that we had the design system to follow, so the structure and colors were correct. However, while following a system, there is not much room for creativity and making decisions. I learned a lot from this assignment because it was the first time I used both SASS and design systems. I found systems to be good for consistency, helping keep the pages similar across different platforms. By having the same interaction patterns, it is easier for users to navigate the website. Additionally, a good design system includes accessibility guidelines, which are beneficial. The design system was mostly applied to the cards, buttons, inputs, colors, and icons.

In this assignment, it was also the first time I used BEM on a larger scale. At first, I did not understand why this technique was necessary. Then, when we learned SASS, I really liked the concept. By using BEM, it is easier to read the code and see which sections of code belong together. With BEM, SASS is also easier to read, and I like that I can use the "&" to connect the sections. For this project, I initially found it hard to understand BEM and how to use it, but now that I have used it throughout the semester, I have learned to appreciate it more.

We had almost never used GitHub either, which was difficult. It was hard to navigate through GitHub without much knowledge, but by using it more, I now understand it better. We had to learn how to resolve conflicts, merge branches, and upload the page to GitHub Pages. I did not like GitHub for this first assignment because I found it hard to understand.



Oblig 2:
For Oblig 2, I worked together with Toril. We worked well together and met often. Therefore, we completed most of the assignment together. Toril added most of the text and the CSS drawing, and I added most of the animations. Other than that, we did the rest while sitting together.

I have now made a lot of changes, the biggest being how the SVGs are implemented. We did not initially know how to implement all those SVGs correctly, so we did what we thought was correct. After talking with other students and doing more research, I found a better way. At first, we had all the SVGs as long paths directly from Illustrator, but with all that code, it was hard to work with. I found out that I could implement them as images, so that is what I have changed now. I kept some paths to make it easier to animate, but by implementing the static SVGs as images instead, the code is much shorter, making it more sustainable. I liked our animations, so I kept most of them, except for the car, which now does not crash into the moon. I also made small changes to some text to make it responsive.

This assignment is not very accessibility-friendly. There is no reduced motion added to this poster. Because this is a remake of an existing poster, there was not much we could change to make it more accessible. However, the text is easy to read because there is a high contrast between text color and background color, and there is alternative text for all the images.

As mentioned earlier, the changes I made have now made the website more sustainable because of much less code. However, the website is not very sustainable because of all the images, which take up a lot of memory.

I learned a lot from this assignment, such as how to implement SVGs in different ways and how to simplify the paths from Illustrator. We used BEM and SASS, which I learned better in this assignment than in the first. This was also the first time I animated, and by having to animate in different ways, I learned different methods, identifying which worked well and which were less effective. In the improved version, I also had to work more with positioning and responsiveness, which I had done before, but it is always good to practice more.

We used GitHub for this assignment as well, and I got to understand how to use it much better than in Oblig 1. Toril knew more about GitHub than I did, so she taught me a lot. Now I understand why it is a great tool and how to navigate, push and pull commits, merge, and solve conflicts more easily.

While animating with different methods, I found the best way to be using CSS with @keyframes. Compared to animations done in HTML, I found keyframes much more organized and clean. If I had more time to improve, I would make something better with CSS drawing. If I were to do this assignment from the beginning again, I would probably have a more strict plan from the start instead of just starting to implement without knowing the best way to do it.



Oblig 3:
For Oblig 3, I made all the SVGs in Illustrator and implemented them either as images or with paths. Then, I placed the different story slides in the order I liked. Afterwards, I animated all the SVGs I wanted to have in motion. At the end, the group together found text we found relevant to tell the story. Throughout this process, I tried to use BEM correctly and keep clean code in both HTML and SASS. We implemented the intersection observer afterwards, which Nora and I did together.

I was not completely satisfied with the assignment upon delivery, but I did not have more time to correct everything at that time. Therefore, I have made a lot of changes now. I made changes both from the feedback we received and from things I knew I wanted to change. First, I created a new storyboard, which changed the story from: "Why is fast fashion bad, and what can we do about it?" to: "Explaining what fast fashion is, why it is bad, and what we can do about it." From there, I had to remove a page and add some new ones.

I created new SVGs and changed all the text to follow the new storyboard. I also made a more captivating topic and highlighted the important keywords. For the text, I tried to use as little text as possible while still being descriptive enough. I changed some colors for some of the slides based on feedback, such as making the landfill darker and changing the kids' skin colors to be more diverse. The last page was also very boring and had a lot of text, so I upgraded that page by creating a new background, shortening the text, rearranging some elements, and adding cool bullet points instead of regular ones. I also missed implementing reduced motion in the initial assignment, which I have now added to most of the animations. Some animations are small and slow originally, so I did not add reduced motion to those, but I changed the biggest, most visible animations.

The accessibility of the page is now better because of the added reduced motion, but it could still improve. I added backgrounds to the text, but it can still be hard to read in some places because of elements in the background. I checked the accessibility of the page using the Lighthouse tool, which returned green/good on most parts.

I also tried to make the page more sustainable by using img for SVGs instead of long paths where possible, but the code is still very long. I would say that it is not the most sustainable page because of all the SVGs and many different colors. The more minimalistic a website is, the more sustainable it is, with whitespace, etc. This is not a very minimalistic website. However, we used SVGs, which are smaller files compared to PNGs, for example.

This was the assignment I think I learned the most from. I used BEM and SASS more, so I feel like I am starting to use them more effectively. I also used the intersection observer for the first time, which was not used much, so I would need to practice it more. But now I know what it is, and that it is a good "tool," and also good for sustainability. There were a lot of animations in this assignment, so from what I learned in Oblig 2, I only used @keyframes and GSAP animations, and got to use them a lot, so I feel like I actually learned them. I did not use GSAP for Oblig 2, so I learned that while working on this assignment. I liked it a lot and found it just as good as @keyframes, clean and easy to understand. With reduced motion, I did not even know what that was, and it is a great and important thing to implement.

If I had more time now or were to start this assignment from scratch, I would keep the same theme because this is something I actually care about. However, I would make the different pages more connected. I would create a connection for every slide and change the way I tell the story, so it feels more like a story website rather than just an informational website. I would also test out horizontal scrolling and add more interactivity to the page, where users can click on some elements to trigger animations or display text information boxes, for example.
